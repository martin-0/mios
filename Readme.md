# MIOS
My **attempt** to write something. Calling it an OS would be .. overstatement. I've decided to create README file to keep main notes on what I was doing last time and what should I do. Coming back to this project after few months is painful.

## Current TODO
**ext2 boot module** - resolve the symlink issues
Maybe the best option here would be just to drop the support and continue without it. I can come back to it later (solve one problem at a time).


### To run the VM
```sh
make disk
make
./run.sh
```
